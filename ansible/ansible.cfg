# ansible/ansible.cfg
#
# Controller-side defaults for this repository.
# Run Ansible from within the `ansible/` directory so relative paths resolve.
#
# Security note:
# - host_key_checking should ideally be True (default) to prevent MITM.
#   If you are bootstrapping fresh hosts, add them to known_hosts first
#   (e.g. `ssh-keyscan -H <ip> >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts`) rather than disabling checks.
