# playbooks/tailscale.yml
#
# Installs Tailscale and ensures tailscaled is running.
# This playbook does NOT automatically run `tailscale up` because that typically
# requires an auth key and policy decisions (exit nodes, routes, tags).
# After install, authenticate interactively or via your organization's standard process.
